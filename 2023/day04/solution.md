# Day-4 of 90daysofdevops

Welcome to Day-4 of the #90DaysofDevOps Challenge. Today, we will 
look into Kernel, Shell, and Shell Scripting. So, let's dive in !!!

### What is Kernel?

A Kernel is a core of the Linux Operating System. It completely 
control's over everything in the system. It acts as an interface between
 the application and hardware.

It manages the following resources of the Linux System:

1. File Management
2. Process Management
3. I/O Management
4. Memory Management
5. Device Management

### What is Shell?

A Shell is a program that provides an interface to the user through 
which it can interact with Operating System. It is a command line 
interpreter through which the user can input simple human-readable 
commands through the keyboard after that command is sent to Kernel to 
perform the task.

There are two types of Shell:

a) Command Line Interface(CLI)

b) Graphical User Interface(GUI)

### What is a Shell Script?

A Shell Script is a file containing a series of commands. The shell 
reads these commands and executes them one by one. The shell script has 
an extension .sh.

Shell Script can do the following tasks:

a) Automate Tasks

b) Customize Workflow

c) Perform System Configuration

d) Integrate Tools and Processes

### What is #!/bin/bash? can we write #!/bin/sh as well?

The `#!/bin/bash` is called bang or shebang, it is the 
first line in the bash script. It indicates that the script should be 
interpreted using a bash shell. Bash(Bourne-Again-Shell) is a widely 
used shell and it is the default shell in most Linux Distribution 
Systems.

Yes, you can write `#!/bin/sh` instead of `#!/bin/bash` . The `sh` interpreter is a generic reference to the system's default shell.

### Tasks:

### Write a shell script to print a message.

```
Bash code#!/bin/sh
echo " I am following 90daysofdevopschallenge

Shell scripting opens up a world of possibilities for automation, 
customization, and efficient management of your systems and processes.
